  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hello! I'm {{author}}, and this is my personal blog where I share thoughts on technology, life, and everything in between.</p>

    <h2>Current Role</h2>
    <p>I am currently Head of Engineering at <a href="https://zumi.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zumi.app</a>, building the next generation of AI-enabled, deeply integrated hospitality software.</p>

    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p>Before that, I held various roles at different startups/scaleups most recently Moneyhub, working on open banking, open finance, and payments across banking data, pensions, savings, and investments.</p>
    
    <h2>What I Write About</h2>
    <p>This blog covers a variety of topics that interest me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Programming, software development, and tech trends</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> Lessons learned, productivity tips, and life experiences</li>
      <li><strong>Thoughts and Ideas:</strong> Random musings and philosophical discussions</li>
      <li><strong>Book Reviews:</strong> Thoughts on books I've read and found valuable</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Like all programmers I have a graveyard of half baked ideas. Few make it beyond my laptopâ€™s hard drive but the ones below made it into the wild for better or worse, mainly fun.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hello World in every language. Why? Because why not?</strong><br/>
        <a href="https://github.com/jordanjoecooper/hello-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jordanjoecooper/hello-world</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dont wait for tomorrow.</strong><br/>
        Super basic view of how long different age groups spend their time in different country and how much time you have left.<br/>
        <a href="https://dontwaitfortomorrow.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dontwaitfortomorrow.uk</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Super simple static waitlist</strong><br/>
        Open Source basic static waitlist, runs fully in the browser no DB or services needed. Used by a few busy London cafes.<br/>

    </ul>
