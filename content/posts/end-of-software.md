In only the paravoid survive Andy Grove talks about inflection points. In terms I understand that means massive scale change happening across one or more industries but equally change extended across national or international society, things that can affect either a company, its product or people and what they do. The internet in hindsight is an obviously inflection point, but hindsight is a wonderful thing and only apparent after the fact. Several other hype cycles have occured that came to ultimately very little change yet despite promoters screaming from the sun rise to the sun set about their 'thing'.

Technological change particularly in software obviously moves quickly, well. . . sort of, there are years where nothing perceptible changes despite many things changing and days when the industry appears to tilt itself flat like a blackbird sunning in the grass. It becomes quite difficult to discern these events and what their meaning is, to understand you bury your head in the detail, but bury to far and oyu drink the cola and cannot see wood for the tree's, it is therefore a difficult balance that requires frequent pause, review and ultimately digging into opposing sides of information.

So then, is the rapid mobilisation of artificial intelligence the end of software?

Based on todays information I dont think we know with any fine degree of certainty, of course like gamblers at the fair there are people running businesses who will tell you that you are a fool because its clearly the end. My response to those people is bravo at their vision, tenacity, drive and belief. They are the change makers. But the gold prospector should always be wary of the people selling shovels and telling them what they wish to hear about where to dig, they only care for you buying their shovels, they do not care if you use them well or if you find gold. The same rule applies here.

What do we know for sure? Some software is ancient and even with modern advances has not changed much at all, that software is embedded in industries resistant to change at all costs to maintain stability. One barrier to building and deploying software was being able to write it , no different to speaking another language, you have to learn it first - This barrier has been smashed, anyone can now create software, this is truly wonderful for both normal people but programmers as well.

What do we know will not change?
- Complexity remains, AI may help speed up its understandingt but it will not remove it. Particularly in extremely niche complex systems.
- AI will continue to improve and those that dont adopt it in sensible ways will suffer in others. Equally those that adopt an overreliance will lose what they have learnt and suffer cognitive decline in any areas of overreliance.
- Software will continue to be written and grow in volume.
- Software related tools, languages and other areas will contiue to require development and maintenence as will anything and everything built using any of these areas.
