    <p>I write code and build products. There's something deeply satisfying about taking an idea that doesn't yet exist and through careful thought and deliberate craft, making it real. The best code isn't about what you add. It's about what you remove. Understanding what truly matters and having the discipline to let go of everything else. I've built teams and companies from scratch, and that same principle applies. Start with what's essential. Build with intention. Scale with purpose. This is where I share thoughts on that process and on the craft of turning intention into reality.</p>

    <h2>Current Role</h2>
    <p>I am currently Head of Engineering at <a href="https://zumi.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zumi.app</a>, building the next generation of AI-enabled, deeply integrated hospitality software.</p>

    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p>Before that, I held various roles at different startups/scaleups most recently Moneyhub, working on open banking, open finance, and payments across banking data, pensions, savings, and investments.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Like all programmers I have a graveyard of half baked ideas. Few make it beyond my laptop's hard drive but the ones below made it into the wild for better or worse, mainly fun.</p>
