    <blockquote>
      <p>"I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don't have any real knowledge."<br>
      — Charlie Munger, Poor Charlies Almanack</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."<br>
      — Warren Buffet</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us inhibit, you are like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest."<br>
      — Charlie Munger, Poor Charlies Almanack</p>
    </blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"If a god were to tell you, 'Tomorrow, or at best the day after, you will be dead,' you would not unless the most abject of men, be greatly solicitous whether it was to be the later day, rather than the morrow - for what is the difference between them? In the same way, do not reckon it of great moment whether it will come years and years hence, or tomorrow"<br>
      — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations(47)</p>
