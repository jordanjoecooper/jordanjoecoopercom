    <!-- ものづくり (Monozukuri): A relatively recent word (late 90s) in the wonderful Japanese language. It is the Japanese philosophy of craftsmanship and manufacturing excellence. Combining "mono" (thing) and "zukuri" (the act of making), it describes a mindset that values precision, pride, and the continuous pursuit of perfection. -->

    <p>Collection of quotes and aphorisms that I've found interesting or inspiring from various sources, typically in books but sometimes conversations, podcasts or blog posts</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things."<br>
      — Leonardo da Vinci</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don't have any real knowledge."<br>
      — Charlie Munger, Poor Charlie's Almanack</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Take a simple idea, and take it seriously."<br>
      — Charlie Munger, Poor Charlie's Almanack</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Don't let go too soon but don't hang on too long, find a balance."<br>
      — Morrie Schwartz, Tuesdays with Morrie</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."<br>
      — Warren Buffett</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us inhabit, you are like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest."<br>
      — Charlie Munger, Poor Charlie's Almanack</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"There is no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing."<br>
      — Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Mad, Bad & Dangerous to know</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"If a god were to tell you, 'Tomorrow, or at best the day after, you will be dead,' you would not unless the most abject of men, be greatly solicitous whether it was to be the later day, rather than the morrow - for what is the difference between them? In the same way, do not reckon it of great moment whether it will come years and years hence, or tomorrow"<br>
      — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (47)</p>
