And in part they are right and in part wrong. In exactly the same way people were wrong when Henry Ford introduced the first cheap mass produced car. Innovation does take things away but equally it produces more.</p><p>We&#39;re living in a transformative era where artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving from a specialized tool to a ubiquitous presence in our daily lives. The pace of advancement is both exciting and concerning.</p><p>As someone working in technology, I&#39;m fascinated by the possibilities AI presents. Yet, I also recognize the importance of approaching this technology thoughtfully and responsibly. We need to consider not just what AI can do, but what it should do.</p><p>The key will be finding the right balance - leveraging AI&#39;s capabilities while maintaining human agency and ethical considerations at the forefront.
